## Hello World! 👋🏽
## Daniel Williams
#### Information Security and Computer Science
My name is Daniel Williams, and I am a recent graduate! I earned my degree in Information and Computer Science from Park University at the age of 19. I am now looking for opportunities to not only learn more in this field, but apply the knowledge I have earned from my time at Park University. My main interests are information security and program development! I am open to entry level roles in cybersecurity, or software development!


- 📖 I’m currently learning about CISA and HIPAA.
