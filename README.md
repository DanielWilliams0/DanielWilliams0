## Hello World! 👋🏽

My name is Daniel Williams, and I am a recent graduate! I earned my degree in Information and Computer Science from Park University at the age of 19. I am now looking for opportunities to not only learn more in this field, but apply the knowledge I have earned from my time at Park University. My main interests are information security and web design! I am currently learning about game development, as well as machine learning!
